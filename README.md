# 3110

## This class was an excursion through various data structures and algorithms. What fun!

**lab2** contains a continuation of lab1, which is lost to the ages. Added multiple objects and incorporates class templating. Used custom linked-lists.

**lab3** contains a continuation of lab2. Breaks each object into its own class/header files. Adds an abstract base class, inheritance, and polymorphism. Uses STL containers.

**lab4** contains a continuation of lab3. Adds a hash table. Uses separate chaining as a collision resolution system.

**lab5** contains early algorithm analysis practice by timing various sorting algorithms. 

**lab6** continuation of lab4. Implements a 2-3-4 tree. Not very well, I might add.

**lab7** Well, I wish I had included better comments on what this one was about. It's pretty deprecated, and I haven't spent the time to get it running again to figure out what it's about. The code is pretty though.
